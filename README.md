# game-theory

A Python implementation of game theory algorithms, such as best responses and iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies, to determine pure strategy and mixed strategy Nash equilibria.

Additionally, for learning purposes there is the option to print the calculation steps of each algorithm, similar to William Spaniel's *Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook*.

Payoff matrices can be imported and exported as CSV files. Some example games are provided in the "games" folder and can easily be used in the Jupyter notebook.
